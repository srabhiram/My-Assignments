    <p>
      Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe
      produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few
      ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much
      better than the boxed stuff).
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Step1</b> <br />
      Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make
      a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until
      smooth. <br />
      <b>Step 2</b><br />
      Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop
      the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake;
      cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip
      and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
